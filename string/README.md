The reason you need to split the string before reversing it is because strings in Dart (and many other programming languages) are immutable. This means that once a string is created, it cannot be changed. 

When you split the string, you convert it into a list of characters, which is a mutable data structure. Lists can be modified, so you can reverse the order of the elements in the list. Once you have the reversed list, you can join the characters back together to form a new string.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:
1. **Split the string**: `input.split("")` converts the string `"Hello"` into a list of characters: `["H", "e", "l", "l", "o"]`.
2. **Reverse the list**: `input.split("").reversed` reverses the list to: `["o", "l", "l", "e", "H"]`.
3. **Join the list**: `input.split("").reversed.join()` joins the reversed list back into a string: `"olleH"`.

Without splitting the string into a list of characters, you wouldn't have a mutable data structure to reverse. That's why splitting is a necessary step in this process.
